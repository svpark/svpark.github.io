## Current Project


My current research is for my master's thesis. I am using an ongoing data set collected in the Sensorimotor Control Lab to create statistical models to draw the relationships that exist between lifestyle and demographic factors and our cognitive performance. 

Some other work with this battery surrounding cannabis and cognitive performance have been done by my lab mate, Assel Al-Bayati, and can be found as [presentations](https://deniseh.lab.yorku.ca/presentations/) on the Lab's website. Publications are forthcoming!

## Past Projects

I worked on two main projects during my undergraduate. 

### Multisensory Integration 

My thesis research under [Dr. GeneviÃ¨ve Desmarais](https://drupal-ha.mta.ca/directory/genevieve-desmarais) concerned the Colavita Visual Dominance Effect. 

> Colavita Visual Dominance Effect: An audiovisual phenomenon whereby we tend to neglect an auditory component of a bimodal audiovisual stimulus [(Colavita, 1974)](https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03203962). 

We tested how robust this effect would be when taken outside the controlled lab setting by creating an online study. This work was presented as a poster at the [Canadian Society for Brain, Behaviour, and Cognitive Science's](https://www.csbbcs.org/home) Annual meeting in 2021.

### Bayesian Classficiation of Illustraions

I worked under [Dr. Michael Cormier](mailto:micormier@mta.ca) on creating a Bayesian classification program to distinguish illustrations printed from copperplate etchings from woodcut engravings (See [CV](/cv)). This was an interdisciplinary collaboration with [Dr. Lauren Beck](https://mta.ca/directory/lauren-beck), who are both now associated with the [Centre for Early Modern Visual Culture](https://www.cemvc.ca/researcher-profiles). We presented this work at Computer and Robot Vision 2020. Conference paper can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1109/CRV50864.2020.00020).
