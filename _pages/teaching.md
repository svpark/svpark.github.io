## Statistical Methods and Research Design

I have been a teaching assistant supporting undergraduate students' learning in statistical methods and research design for 4 years. As a Teaching Assistant for Statistical Methods I & II at York University, I was responsible for leading tutorials. This involved creating materials on topics on univariate parametric statistics (t-tests/ANOVA to regression).

## Professional Development

While at York, I have taken efforts to improve my pedagogical practices by pursuing training and certifications through the [Teaching Commons](https://www.yorku.ca/teachingcommons/teaching-development/). 

I have earned my Senior and Junior Records of Completion by attending  a series of teaching development workshops and a symposium. I also completed the Teaching Assistant Certificate in Teaching (TACT), a semester-long course that is accredited by the Educational Developer Caucus aimed at improving Teaching Assistants' competencies in post-secondary education (or more information, see [CV](/cv)). Lastly, I am enrolling in the Senior Teaching Assistant Program, the most advanced certificate offered to graduate students.

I am currently completing the Certificate of Proficiency in Teaching for eLearning. While this program is aimed at instructors, I have the teaching experience and aim to be fluent in the best pedagogy to support students in the online and hybrid climates. The certificate comprises 5 courses and a summative project.
