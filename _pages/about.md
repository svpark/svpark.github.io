Hello!

I am currently a Master's student in Psychology at York University in the [Sensorimotor Control Lab](https://deniseh.lab.yorku.ca/) under the Supervision of Dr. Denise Henriques. I completed my BSc (Hons) from [Mount Allison University](https://mta.ca/) in the [Dr. Genevi√®ve Desmarais'](https://mta.ca/directory/genevieve-desmarais) Multisensory Integration lab. 

My background is in the area of cognitive neuropsychology. My undergraduate work surrounded multisensory integration and my current master's work concerns modelling how lifestyle factors can affect our cognition (Check out my [research](/research/) page for more info). In the broad sense, I am interested in any and all mechanisms and processes affecting our cognition across the lifespan, from attention to the environment! 

On the non-educational side (the part of me that is *not* a student), I grew up on the east coast of Canada in Nova Scotia, so I am a maritimer at heart. I made the short move to Sackville, New Brunswick for my undergraduate studies and now I have made the longer move to Toronto, Ontario. 

When I'm not trying to debug my code, I can be often be found out and about in the city on a walk pretending that Lake Ontario is the Atlantic Ocean. Coming from "Canada's ocean playground", I love all things with the water and coast including swimming, sailing, canoeing, and hiking. I love being active in my community and volunteering with children and older adults, re-watching my comfort shows, and keeping my cat, Tobi, away from my dinner plate!
